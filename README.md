## Hi!, Tomás here (￣▽￣)ノ

### About me <(￣︶￣)>
I'm 4th year Software Engineering student at the [Pontificial Catholic University of Chile](https://www.uc.cl/). I love to learn and challenge myself, and have a passion for gaming, cooking and photography, though the results of that last one rarely see the light of day lol. Lately been obsessed with coffee, currently drinking an extremely nice colombian bean and saving up for a decent espresso machine.
